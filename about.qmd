# Hobbies

This is my favorite section! Let's talk about what I like!

-   Reading

    -   I will be honest, I have been reading much less than I would like to, but I am trying my best to catch up! You can find my *storygraph* [here](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/litstlg) and my *goodreads* [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63667966-doa).
    -   My reading goal for 2024 is 30 books, which isn't a lot, but it's realistic and that's what matters. (Right?)

-   Writing

    -   I have been writing since middle school and even though I've never won [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) yet, I never lose hope that maybe next year will be the year I win my first NaNoWriMo.

-   Listening to music

    -   This section will be update with a playlist soon!

-   Solving puzzles

    -   If I don't do my NYT puzzles every day I can't go to sleep. It might be a problem.
